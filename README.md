# Context and Information for Stakeholders

## Background:
Our company recognized the need to modernize and unify the disparate reporting systems in use across our operations. Historically, data collection and analysis were fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and gaps in our insights. To address this, the company took the strategic decision to standardize and automate its reporting systems using advanced system analytics. The project you're now looking at is a result of this initiative. It not only showcases the possibilities but also leverages the power of cloud-based solutions for scalability and real-time data access.

## Purpose:
This software is an embodiment of our vision for the future of data management in solar installations. Its objectives are:
1. **Streamlined Monitoring**: Provide a unified platform to oversee the health and efficiency of all solar installations.
2. **Automated Reporting**: Eliminate manual processes by automatically generating daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Furnish stakeholders with relevant data for timely decisions and interventions.

## Key Features:

### Data Collection:
   - Automated fetching of data about solar installations every 10 seconds from the cloud.
   - Real-time information includes location, energy production, efficiency rate, temperature, and maintenance status.
   - Although the current data is demonstrative, in a full-scale deployment, it will integrate with actual sensors and databases.

### Solar Installation Dashboard:
   - Comprehensive view of all installations with data like total number, those needing maintenance, average efficiency, and daily energy production.
   - Highlighting of top and bottom 5 installations based on performance for quick reviews.
   - A visual pie chart showcases the overall health metrics of all installations.
   - Installations needing attention are marked distinctly for immediate action.

### Reports and Analytics:
   - Cloud-integrated reporting allows for the download of daily, weekly, and monthly performance metrics.
   - Graphical representations provide stakeholders a clear picture of installation statuses and trends.

## Web Page Design:
- The cloud-based webpage offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies data interaction.
- Various presentation formats, like tables, cards, and graphs, enhance the user experience and facilitate understanding.
- Prominent display of key metrics and easily accessible report downloads empower stakeholders with data on demand.

## Strategic Benefits to Stakeholders:

1. **Unified Monitoring**: A single platform now replaces previously scattered reporting systems, ensuring cohesive oversight.
2. **Instant Access**: Leveraging the cloud means stakeholders can access data anytime, anywhere, ensuring they're always informed.
3. **Scalability**: The cloud-based approach guarantees that as the company grows, the system can effortlessly handle increased data loads.
4. **Reduced Overheads**: Automating and standardizing reporting eliminates redundancies, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency.
